This is a template for the camera prototypes for
a uniform implementation of the different camera calibration
functions.

WE ENCOURAGE to follow the current template together with the
coding guidelines document:


FUNCTIONS: There will be two tests of fucntions:
- <calibration_constant_name>_calculation(): those that calculates
calibration constants.
- <calibration_constant_name>_application(): applies the calculated
calibration constant to the raw data for its calibration.

IMPORTANT: if the current scheme, for any reason does not fit into
your camera calibration, please contact DATA experts to search for
common alternatives.
